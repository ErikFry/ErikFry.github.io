        <h2>Injury update!</h2>
        <p class="newsText">Injuries and absentees cost Leeds United greatly on
          their return to action following the international break. Marcelo
          Bielsa's side went into the two-week layoff on the back of their first
           Premier League win of the campaign, after Watford were dispatched at
           Elland Road last time out. But any hope that they would be able to
           carry any momentum forward was dashed following a disappointing 1-0
           defeat to Southampton at St Mary's. Marcelo Bielsa was forced into
           three changes for the south coast trip, with Junior Firpo, Kalvin
           Philllips and Raphinha all dropping out of the starting XI.

          <h3>Calvin Philllips</h3>
          <p class="newsText">Although Kalvin Phillips travelled to Southampton, he was not named
             in Marcelo Bielsa's matchday squad. A calf strain saw him withdraw
             from Gareth Southgate's injury squad, with Bielsa confirming after
             the Saints defeat that he has also been carrying a hip problem.
             "In the case of Phillips, in the two weeks after the Watford game,
             he was working with an injury that was bothering him, that was a
             muscular problem in his calf," said the Whites boss following the
             1-0 defeat. "During those days, for a while now he's had a problem
             in his hip and those two joined together, and even if he was close
             to being able to play the game, the conditions weren't the
             necessary ones for him to play." Expect another update when Bielsa
             faces the press this week ahead of Wolves.</p>
